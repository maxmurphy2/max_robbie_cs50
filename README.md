# max_robbie_cs50
Max Murphy and Robbie Owen's repository for CS50 final project.

To run our project, please copy our repository into the CS50 codespace or a new codespace with the relevant downloads of python, flask, flasksession, etc. Once it is set up, type flask run into the terminal to visit our website. 

Our website creates a choropleth map (a heat map) of tweets globally. In order to generate this map, we take whatever tweet hashtag you would like to search and cross reference it with a database of tweets with their associated geotags. To search for your tweet and create the corresponding heat map enter your tag into the search bar and press search!
